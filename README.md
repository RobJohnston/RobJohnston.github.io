My Personal Website
===================

This repo it set-up to build a website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deploy at https://robjohnston.github.io/.

I'm currently using the [Tailwind](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-tailwind/) theme with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments.

The build-and-deploy process is triggered by a commit to the "main" branch.
