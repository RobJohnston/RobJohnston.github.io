My Personal Website
===================

This repo it set-up to build a website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deploy to https://robjohnston.github.io/.

I'm currently using the [Terminal Elegance](https://worktree.ca/robjohnston/terminal-elegance/) theme with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments.

The build-and-deploy process is triggered by a commit to the "main" branch.
